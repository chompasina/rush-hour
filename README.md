# RushHour

RushHour is a module 2 application using Ruby, Sinatra, and ActiveRecord to track web traffic on a client's site and provide analysis to clients.

This application allows us to analyze payload data from another website by accepting submission of user payloads, applying statistical analysis to the payloads, and displaying this data to our user/client via a HTML interface.

In order to interpret the payloads, our application parsed JSON format. 

While working on this project, I developed a keen understanding of how to use databases for storage and ActiveRecord to retrieve data from our Ruby database, how to build and understand normalized SQL-based relational database structures, and how HTTP verbs (GET, PUT, and POST) work, and the role of headers, referrers, and payloads. 

I would have liked to improve our view logic which has some extra logic that could have been pushed down the stack. I also would hve like to spend more time styling with HTML and CSS.
